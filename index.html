        <h2>Six of the most influential women in Computer Science</h2>
         <p>We often see how machines or men were the first programmers and the ones who helped change the world we live in today. But least we have not forgotten that women contributed to a lot of programming languages and helped change the male-dominated field of technology. Women’s contributions are frequently left out or are unheard of, so here are six of the most famous women in technology:</p>

            <p class="info-p">Ada is referred to as the first programmer because she had written notes that explained how the notion of a specific engine could transition calculation to computation. She is one of the famous women in technology and every second Tuesday in October is known as Ada Lovelace Day to celebrate the achievements of women in STEM careers.</p>

Her work was crucial in making the first moon landing, Apollo 11, possible in 1969.</p>

            <p class="info-p">Lamarr’s greatest scientific triumph was intended for the US navy during the second world war, but is now used in modern wireless communication. Her “secret communication system” used “frequency hopping” to guide radio-controlled missiles underwater in a way that was undetectable by the enemy. She developed the basis for wifi communications.</p>

In 1961 she joined the digital computer group and contributed to the LNC development of TX-2, as she designed and wrote the operators manual for the final console design. She is known for helping develop the first personal computer and was also the first person to have a PC in her home.</p>

            <p class="info-p">Grace joined the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corp in 1949 where she designed a compiler which translated programmer’s instructions into computer codes. In 1957, her division developed the first English language data processing complier. After retiring from the Naval Reserve, she was recalled helping standardise the navy’s computer languages.</p>

This was a very big responsibility for Kathrine as the astronaut’s lives were in her hands.</p>
